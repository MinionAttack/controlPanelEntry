# controlPanelEntry
This is a **Batch** script to add an entry for the **original Control Panel** on the **Windows menu** when you do a right click over the Windows menu logo.

I found this script years ago but I realized that maybe more people would need it, because for some tasks the old control panel it's more usefull than the new **Windows Configuration** menu. This script works with the lastest Windows update (**Windows 10 October Update**).

After execute the script and restart the computer or reload your user session, when you do right click on the menu icon, you will see a new entry for the **old Control Panel**. This is how it looks:

And if you click on that entry you will open the **old Control Panel**:
