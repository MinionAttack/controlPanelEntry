# controlPanelEntry
This is a **Batch** script to add an entry for the **original Control Panel** on the **Windows menu** when you do a right click over the Windows menu logo.

I found this script years ago but I realized that maybe more people would need it, because for some tasks the old control panel it's more usefull than the new **Windows Configuration** menu. This script still works with the latest major Windows update.

After execute the script and restart the computer or reload your user session, when you do right click on the menu icon, you will see a new entry for the **old Control Panel**. This is how it looks:

And if you click on that entry you will open the **old Control Panel**:
